# DSA-ALL-JS--1

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations and problem-solving exercises in JavaScript and C. The goal is to provide a hands-on resource for learning, practicing, and experimenting with various DSA concepts and coding challenges.

## Folder Structure

- **Root Directory**
  - Contains JavaScript files for individual problems (e.g., `136.js`, `1470.shuffle-the-array.js`, etc.).
  - Includes utility scripts and experimental files (e.g., `addSum.js`, `elo.js`, `container.js`).
  - HTML files for running and testing scripts in the browser (e.g., `index.html`).

- **C_Language/**
  - Contains C language implementations and related files.
  - Includes both `.c` source files and JavaScript equivalents for cross-language practice.
  - Subfolders such as `C_Language/` may contain additional scripts and HTML files for modular organization.

## Key Features

- **DSA Implementations:** Solutions to common DSA problems, including arrays, linked lists, sorting algorithms, and more.
- **Cross-Language Practice:** Many problems are implemented in both JavaScript and C for deeper understanding.
- **Browser Testing:** HTML files are provided to run and test JavaScript solutions directly in the browser.
- **Personal Experiments:** Some files are dedicated to experimenting with logic and alternative approaches.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-ALL-JS--1.git
   cd DSA-ALL-JS--1
   ```

2. **Run JavaScript Files**
   - Use Node.js to execute JavaScript files:
     ```sh
     node 136.js
     ```
   - Or open `index.html` in your browser and use the script tags to run specific files.

3. **Run C Files**
   - Compile and run C files using GCC or any C compiler:
     ```sh
     gcc AddTwoNums.c -o AddTwoNums
     ./AddTwoNums
     ```
